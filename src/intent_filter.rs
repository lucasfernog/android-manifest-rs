/// Specifies the types of intents that an activity, service, or broadcast receiver can

/// An intent filter declares the capabilities of its parent component â€” what an activity
/// or service can do and what types of broadcasts a receiver can handle. It opens the
/// component to receiving intents of the advertised type, while filtering out those that
/// are not meaningful for the component. Most of the contents of the filter are
/// described by its [`<action>`], [`<category>`], and [`<data>`] subelements.
///
/// For a more detailed discussion of filters, see the separate [`Intents and Intent
/// Filters`] document, as well as the [`Intents Filters`]
/// section in the introduction.
